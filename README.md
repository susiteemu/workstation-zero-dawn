# My Workstation Zero Dawn

Not planned and implemented by Sobeck and the Alphas but it does restore the most important tool to my workstation after unforeseen plague or simply because it has been time for a laptop renewal.

Each tool has its own playbook file. Some common configuration variables are stored in `group_vars/all` and some common tasks are organized under `common_tasks`.
